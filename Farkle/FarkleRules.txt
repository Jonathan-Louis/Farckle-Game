The goal of Farkle is to be the first player to reach 10,000 points.
On each turn the current player rolls all six dice and then sets 
aside any point dice. 
The point dice are 1's , 5's or three dice rolled at he same time 
that match. 
1's are worth 100, 5's are worth 50 and three of a kind is worth the
value of the dice * 100. 
For example with three 3's the score would be 300. 
The only exception is with 1's, if the player rolls three 1's the 
score is 1,000. 
Each player must score 1,000 points to open for the game. 
Once the player has this score they may stop at any point and score 
the points to their total points. 
If the player is open prior to starting their turn they may stop at 
any point. 
If the dice are rolled and no scoring dice are rolled then the 
players turn ends and they get 0 points for the turn. 
If the player has all 6 dice as scoring dice then all 6 dice must be
rolled 1 additional time before stopping. 
Once a player reaches 10,000 points total each other player gets 1 
additional turn to attempt to beat them. 
The player with the highest score after this last sequence of turns 
wins the game.
